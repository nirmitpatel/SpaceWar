# SpaceWar! User Manual
This is the user manual for the updated version of the classic game SpaceWar! Please read this manual to understand the game logic and game controls. 

# Game Controls:
This is a two-user game so the controls for the users are different:

User 1:
D: Rotate the spaceship counter-clockwise 
A: rotate the spaceship clockwise 
Q: Jump the spaceship to random positions (Limited 10 times per game)
SPACEBAR: Shoot bombs (unlimited)

User 2:
LEFT ARROW: move the spaceship left 
RIGHT ARROW: move the spaceship right 
SHIFT: Jump the spaceship to random positions (Limited 10 times per game)
CTRL: Shoot bullets (unlimited)

# Game Logic:
The concept of the game is kept the same. Two spaceships will fight each other to survive while getting attracted to the star and whoever reaches the star first, gets destroyed and the other player wins! Each player has same lives and health. After 10 hits by any object, except the star, the spaceships destroy themselves and the other player automatically wins. 

To add some difficulties, there are asteroids which will be coming out the star. Both players will lose a live or significant health everytime their spaceships hit asteroids until they run out of lives or health. Then automatically the other player wins and the game ends.

Player 1 can ROTATE in any direction and can shoot in any direction. However, Player 2 can MOVE left or right but can only shoot in one direction – the direction of the star. 

Player 1’s ship loses a life if it gets hit by the bullet and player 2’s ship loses health if it gets hit by a bullet. Bullet and bomb can destroy asteroids and each other. 

Each player gets to use “magic” powers to jump anywhere on the screen 10 times per game. Also, while jumping around, both spaceships get “magical powers” to regain all health and lives. This will happen for both players regardless which player uses it.
